    <p>Perhaps it was the middle of January in the present year that I first looked up and saw the mark <span class="dot"></span> on the wall. In order to fix a date it is necessary to remember what one saw. So now I think of the fire; the steady film of yellow light upon the page of my book; the three chrysanthemums in the round glass bowl on the mantelpiece. Yes, it must have been the winter time, and we had just finished our tea, for I remember that I was smoking a cigarette when I looked up and saw the mark <span class="dot"></span> on the wall for the first time. I looked up through the smoke of my cigarette and my eye lodged for a moment upon the burning coals, and that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower came into my mind, and I thought of the cavalcade of red knights riding up the side of the black rock. Rather to my relief the sight of the mark <span class="dot"></span> interrupted the fancy, for it is an old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps. The mark was a small round mark <span class="dot"></span>, black upon the white wall, about six or seven inches above the mantelpiece.</p>
