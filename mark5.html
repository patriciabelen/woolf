Thoughts move away from you and become clear.
Then they move toward you and fade away.

<div id="rotate-words">  
    <div>I can think sitting still as well as standing up. </div>
    <div>And what is knowledge?</div>
    <div>What are our learned men save the descendants of witches and hermits who crouched in caves and in woods brewing herbs,</div>
    <div>interrogating shrew-mice and writing down the language of the stars?</div>
    <div>And the less we honour them as our superstitions dwindle and our respect for beauty and health of mind increases....</div>
    <div>Yes, one could imagine a very pleasant world.</div>
    <div>A quiet, spacious world, with the flowers so red and blue in the open fields. </div>
    <div> A world without professors or specialists or house-keepers with the profiles of policemen,</div>
    <div> a world which one could slice with one’s thought as a fish slices the water with his fin,</div>
    <div>grazing the stems of the water-lilies, hanging suspended over nests of white sea eggs....</div>
    <div>How peaceful it is down here, rooted in the centre of the world and gazing up through the grey waters,</div>
    <div>with their sudden gleams of light, and their reflections–if it were not for Whitaker’s Almanack–</div>
    <div>if it were not for the Table of Precedency!</div>
    </div>
